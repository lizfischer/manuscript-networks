# _Network Analysis for Book Historians_: Supplemental files

This repository houses supplemental files for the book [_Network Analysis for Book Historians: Digital Labour and Data Visualization Techniques_](https://www.arc-humanities.org/9781802702682/network-analysis-for-book-historians/) by Liz Fischer (Arc Humanities Press, 2025.)

The book explores the potential of network analysis as a method for medieval and early modern book history. Presented through case studies of the Cotton Library, the Digital Index of Middle English Verse, and the Pforzheimer Collection, this book offers a blueprint for drawing on extant scholarly resources to visualize relationships between people, text, and books. 

I argue for considering data visualizations as their own kind of **reference works**, in the same family as traditional catalogues, editions, bibliographies, etc. Due to the restrictions of traditional publishing, the visualizations in the book are static snapshots of large, complicated networks, severely limiting the power of the visualizations to serve reference functions.

This repository houses the "raw data" for each visualization in the book, as well as the HTML & Javascript comprising interactive versions that can be downloaded and viewed locally.

For the time being, the interactive versions are also hosted online at https://manuscriptnetworks.online -- the hosted versions are linked below.
